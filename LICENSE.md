In contrast to CC’s licenses that allow copyright holders to choose from a range of permissions while retaining their copyright, CC0 empowers 
yet another choice altogether – the choice to opt out of copyright and database protection, and the exclusive rights automatically granted to 
creators – the “no rights reserved” alternative to our licenses.
